Fork-join parallelism
Start with master thread
    - fork threads with master (ID 0)
    - the "team" of thread can join back to master

-- Interchanging between serial and parallel.

Can even nested fork-join


counter-intuitive to our knowledge
Outside of #pragma
data available to all thread


Hello-world of parallelism

Integrate 4/(1+x)^2 from 0 to 1


NOTE:
Declare nthreads outside of the parallel region and set it value inside the parallel region. The runtime environment might decide to give you fewer threads than you requested!
