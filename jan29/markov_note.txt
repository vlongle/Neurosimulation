1) // What is M_r: the inhibitory reversal potential? Why is it lower-bounded?

2) What is find_index?

Paper's r.v


- External current drive: one Poisson process with exponential inter arrival time for each neuron

X_1, X_2, ..., X_N: N number of neurons


When the spike arrives at X_i, independent flip according to the P distribution for each neuron for connection.

Once having a connection, draw from exponential dist for the delay neuron-neuron time.

Then, the spiked neuron should go to refractory with time from exponential dist tau_R


Reality:
* Keep the now mean of the r.v. in 8-element array.
* Randomly draw time increment from exponential with mean sum (using inverse CDF).
* Use some weird method from find_index to identify which action to take among 8 exponential dist.
