TO RUN
g++-6 -o simulation -fopenmp simulation_june.cpp
./simulation


GOAL:
Generate
SEE in range [5, 5.5]
SIE in range [3, 3.5]
SEI in range [-3.5, -2]
SII in range [-3.5, -3]

Verify lambda as:
(kickE, kickI) = (1000, 1500) and (1500, 1000)
Then we have fE, fI --> SEE, SIE, SEI, SII
R^4 --> R^4

Then, run

To parse the cpp generated data.
$python3 dataGetter.py filename (6 or 4)
Option:
filename: the machine.txt file generated by cpp
int: 6 for the traditional 1000, 3000, 5000 data
4 for the varying lambda data
